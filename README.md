# J10-A Community Mod

Hi all, here is a nice side project that we have been working on. Ever since we saw this FC3 MOD pop up on YouTube we wanted to take it to the next level. With the permission of the original author, @happy cavin, we took his work and adapted it for the wonderful JF-17 made by Deka Ironwork Simulations. We are taking the "early access" route with this mod and sharing it as-is. Work will continue and your help will be appreciated if you have any modding experience.
